Comprehensive Analysis
The "BookHaven" database schema was designed with normalization principles in mind:

1NF Compliance: 
All tables have atomic columns. For example, the Books table has separate columns for title, publication_date, and book_id.

2NF Compliance: 
Each non-primary-key column is fully dependent on the table's primary key. For instance, in the Transactions table, transaction_date depends on transaction_id.

3NF Compliance: 
There are no transitive dependencies. For example, in the Authors table, name depend solely on author_id, not on each other or on collaborator_id.
